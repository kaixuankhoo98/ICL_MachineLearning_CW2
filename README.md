# ICL_MachineLearning_CW2
The second ML coursework (coursework specifications in the pdf file) was about Neural Networks.

## Part 1
In part 1, I created a neural network mini-library from scratch, in which I implemented a linear layer, as well as activation functions Sigmoid and ReLU (including their backwards pass methods), and created an example multi-layer network to demonstrate that it works. In Figure 1.png, we can see the loss decreasing at each epoch, when using this multi-layer network on a provided dataset (iris.dat).
