# ICL_MachineLearning_CW2
The second ML coursework (coursework specifications in the pdf file) was about Neural Networks.

## Part 1
In part 1, I created a neural network mini-library from scratch, in which I implemented a linear layer, as well as activation functions Sigmoid and ReLU (including their backwards pass methods), created an example multi-layer network to demonstrate that it works, and built a trainer to ensure that it all works. In Figure 1.png, we can see the loss decreasing at each epoch, when using this multi-layer network on a provided dataset (iris.dat).

## Part 2
In part 2, the task was to create and train a neural network for regression, using the California House Prices Dataset, published in the paper: Pace, R. Kelley, and Ronald Barry. “Sparse spatial autoregressions.” Statistics Probability Letters 33.3 (1997): 291-297.

In summary, I decided on an architecture, set up a model evaluation (predict and evaluation methods), and performed hyperparameter tuning on the model. A more consise report on part 2 is provided in Part2_summary.pdf.
